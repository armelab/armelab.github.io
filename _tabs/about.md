## About Me

My name is Jirapat Kuengwong, currently working as an IT support. I am highly interested in cyber security in general. 

I build a home lab and use it to learn about and gain hands-on experience on cybersecurity operations, penetration testing, and more. The lab name "Armelab" is named after my Internet nickname, Arme.

I also create this blog site to document my works on my home lab and demonstrate hands-on experiences I gained.

## Certifications

* CompTIA Security+
* Cisco CCNA
